# Programming Assignment 4

## Problem Description

A method that returns a special error code is usually better accomplished by throwing an exception instead. Look at the
class `Account` and do the following.

1. Rewrite the class so that it throws an IllegalAmountException with an appropriate error message instead of returning
-1 as an error code.
2. To make this happen, you will also need to create your own exception class called `IllegalAmountException` within the
`assignment4` package that extends the Exception class.
3. Finally, write test code that attempts to withdraw and deposit invalid amounts and catches the exceptions that 
are thrown.
